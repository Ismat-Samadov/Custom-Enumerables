# Custom Enumerables

Welcome to the Custom Enumerables project! In this project, you'll rebuild several methods from the Enumerable module in Ruby, such as `each`, `map`, `find`, and more. This will give you a deeper understanding of how these methods work under the hood and enhance your knowledge of blocks, iterators, and Ruby's Enumerable module.

## Introduction

You're likely familiar with the Enumerable module in Ruby, which provides convenient iterator methods for arrays, hashes, and other enumerable objects. These methods, such as `each`, `map`, `find`, and `select`, are powerful tools for working with collections of data.

In this project, you'll have the opportunity to rebuild some of these methods from scratch. By doing so, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how they function and strengthen your grasp of fundamental programming concepts like iteration and block handling.

## Assignment

To complete this project, follow these steps:

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**: Start by forking the custom enumerables repository on GitHub and then clone your fork to your local machine.

2. **Setup Locally**: Follow the instructions provided in the README of the repository to set up your local development environment.

3. **Rebuild Custom Enumerable Methods**: You'll find a list of custom enumerable methods in the project. Your task is to implement each of these methods from scratch according to their specifications.

4. **Testing**: Run the provided tests to ensure that your custom enumerable methods behave correctly and pass all the test cases.

5. **Contributing**: If you'd like to contribute improvements or additional features to the project, feel free to submit a pull request.

6. **License**: Make sure to review the project's license and adhere to its terms when using or modifying the code.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, make sure you have Ruby installed on your machine. You'll also need a code editor and a terminal to run commands.

Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-enumerables.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd custom-enumerables
```

Follow the setup instructions provided in the README to configure your local environment and start working on the project.

## Custom Enumerable Methods

Here's a list of custom enumerable methods you'll be rebuilding:

- `each`
- `each_with_index`
- `select`
- `all?`
- `any?`
- `none?`
- `count`
- `map`
- `inject`

Refer to the project's documentation and specifications for details on how to implement each method.

## Testing

The project includes test files for each custom enumerable method. After implementing a method, run the corresponding test file to check if your implementation behaves as expected.

Use the following command to run tests for a specific method (replace `method_name` with the name of the method):

```bash
ruby test_method_name.rb
```

Fix any failures or errors reported by the tests before proceeding to the next method.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute improvements or additional features to the project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your feature or fix.
3. Implement your changes and ensure that all tests pass.
4. Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
5. Submit a pull request to the original repository.


This README provides an overview of the Custom Enumerables project and guides you through the process of completing it. Have fun rebuilding the Enumerable methods and deepening your understanding of Ruby programming!

If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the project maintainers or the Ruby community.

Happy coding!
